      <h2>An Incomplete Dream</h2>

        Once there lived a rich farmer in a remote village of Nepal. He lived happily with his three sons and five daughters. Gradually, they got married one by one and left the home. Only the youngest son lived with his father. One day the youngest son went to India for higher education leaving his parents and younger sister at home. Here in the village, the farmer had to fight a legal case which cost him an arm and a leg. Consequently, he lost most of his land and valuables during the fight. After a few years his son returned home after completing his education. To his surprise, the situation of his house was miserable due to the legal fight.

        Although he was educated he could not find any job easily except for teaching which did not pay much. Moreover, they had to lose more property to settle the case. After a few years the son got married, and the youngest daughter also got married in the same year. Disaster struck the family once again when the father died the same year. After the father’s death, the son had to support the family. He searched for a job everywhere and finally became a teacher in a nearby school. After a few years, he had a son, which gave him happiness to some extent. Then again he had another son after two years.

        Meanwhile, he got an opportunity to be trained at a well-known university. He left home, his wife, and sons sadly in order to get training in Kathmandu. Everyone in the village missed him as he was a good teacher, musician, and comedian. Undoubtedly, he was going to be the head teacher of the school after the training. During his training, there arose a student movement in Kathmandu, especially where he was being trained.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result of this, he returned home and met his beloved wife and sons. After a few weeks, the movement stopped, and he again had to return to Kathmandu even though none of his family members and relatives agreed. He left home in tears, which could not stop the tears of his beloved ones. In those days, it took 3 or 4 days to reach Kathmandu from his village. The very night he returned to his rental room, he was killed mysteriously, leaving everyone and everything in chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
        His wife could not control herself when she heard the terrifying news of his death at the tender age of 27. She herself was just 21 with two small sons who didn’t even know what actually happened in the family. The youngest son was born 8 months after the father’s death.
      </p>
      <p>Thus, the family suffered a lot after the sudden and untimely demise of him. On the other hand, his dream remained incomplete.</p>
